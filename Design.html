                <h1>Styling</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The entire site makes use of the Poppins font, a modern and professional-looking sans-serif font that's a versatile fit for most web applications, and is the reason I chose to employ it on this site.</p>
                <p>
                The primary palette for the site was a virbat cobalt blue (#0000ff) coupled with white and black to give neutral but cool overall appearance . 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Layout</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This site was meant to be a revamped version of the previous submission I had made. I added some interactivity with a dedicated navbar and made it so that it is always apparent what page the user is on, as well as bold titles for the content in it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Navigation</h1>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    The primary navigation is, of course, the navbar that appears on top of every webpage. It highlights in bold the section of the website the user is on at all times, and to the left is the tag that, of course, indicates what the site's purpose is.
