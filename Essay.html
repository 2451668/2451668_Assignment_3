                <p>“Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order.” 
                    This phrase was taken from one of our assigned readings for this course, Design for the Real World, by the late designer and educator Victor Papanek, and is a phrase I like to keep in mind whenever reading or writing about what designing something is and how to do it.

                    As for this assignment, the brief had us select and analyse an SA-made website, examine how it holds up when using and examining its UI/UX, and comment on the ethical aspects of its design practises. It was important to me to select a website that provided products and services that were accessible to and used by many people. For this reason, I chose the website for the telecommunications company Telkom (www.telkom.co.za) and will talk about my experience navigating the site.

                    Established in Johannesburg in 1991, Telkom has been a wired and wireless network operator and service provider for over thirty years, a company many individuals and businesses rely on for providing and facilitating telecommunication. When hearing the name Telkom, what comes to the minds of many is an internet service provider, though they offer a variety of products and IT-related services.

                    The essay will be structured into three primary segments, with the first detailing the overall interface and visual design and coherency. The second will go into experience and navigation/usage. Lastly, a brief portion discusses the ethics and more intangible aspects of the overall interaction between the object and the user. The analysis will primarily be facilitated via two of the course readings: the aforementioned book by Papanek as well as the blogpost, 14 Principles of Design," by the Polish design studio UXpin.

                    When landing on their website, the user is met with a very blue homepage. It is almost entirely the same shade of blue (specifically #0081c2) and is the hue featured almost exclusively on all their branding, apart from plain white. It is a modern site and features a simple, non-sticky header with the navigation bar and its menu beneath it. The homepage is entirely ad space, featuring an interactable slider that a user could click through to review each product offering. There are no sidebars, and so as the user scrolls down the body of the page, a handful of sections feature more texts and graphics in relation to mobile products and internet offerings for the user to look through. The page ends with a large footer in a much darker blue that features many links with various functionality spilt into five columns. When using the nav bar, it expectably prompts drop-down menus that link to the various relevant webpages, all of which are stylistically similar, primarily sporting their signature blue and white look, large gadgetrelated images, and their custom sans-serif typeface throughout all their text.

                    Telkom's design language for their website is visually coherent, aesthetically simple, but effective. The colour palette is limited to just white and blue, with supplementary colouring in the accents and media/imagery. Their typeface is consistent and always a dark colour against a light backdrop, with the spacing of relevant headings making them accessible and easy to read. Looking at how all of this functions experientially, there are parts where Telkom does well and parts where it falls short. From the first click of the link, the user is immediately met with large advertisements for mobile devices and internet packages. This is unsurprising, given the nature of Telkom's business and shows an awareness by them of who their userbase is in this instance: individuals looking to browse or shop for device or data plans. This ad section, however, covers the entirety of the homepage and competes with the header and navbar for the user's visual attention. This has largely to do with all three of these contiguous elements being the same shade of blue, unfortunately causing all of them to blend with each other. The navbar features labels with downward arrows, standard for indicating a drop-down menu that features information relevant to the menu title in a simple black-onwhite colour scheme. This layout has a three-step principal and makes it easy to get to what a shopper or customer would be looking for in this context without looping around many hyperlinks and pages. It also helps offset the fact that the homepage is already cluttered with labels all around the edges that are in a small font size and might be jarring to navigate through. Immediate call-to-actions are buttons and labels in an interesting bright magenta colour, in contrast to the rest of the cool-toned website.

                    The product layouts are revenant to the user's interests and feature most of the information at a glance about products without the user needing to even interact with the site in some instances. The phones and other gadgets are displayed with clear bold headings and associated imagery and feature the plans they come standard with and the price for that instance of the bundle. These sparse and simple figures let the user making cursory mental comparisons about offerings on the go without needing to tabulate their own values (though an option to rigidly compare plans and offerings exist, too, if that is something a particular user requires).

                    The interface and experience remain consistent across both desktop mobile browsers and devices, though the font and graphic scaling are naturally much larger on mobile displays to accommodate the fact that when on a phone, users would not want to incessantly pinch in to view and read microtext. This comes at the cost of the website being trickier to navigate, not in terms of complexity, but because everything requires a lot of swiping and tapping to traverse through different pages, as opposed to a few clicks on a desktop, which shows you everything on said page. This, however, is not necessarily a fault of Telkom but rather the nature of mobile web browsing.

                    Considering that this is first and foremost an e-commerce website, Telkom's primary objective is to get you to purchase one of their products and services. There are a few invasive elements when first viewing the site that may annoy the user, such as the requirement to accept some digital cookies, that collect user data under the guise of making the site more personal for the user, something a user may have no need for. There are also occasional popups to subscribe to Telkom's digital mailing and prompts for knowing the user's location and sending notifications.

                <p>
                    I mentioned earlier that there are typically two camps of users who'd come to this website generally; those simply browsing the range and planning a protentional purchase, and the second group being those with the intention of making a purchase or are very close to it. Telkom's does a good job catering to both without the expense of the other, in that after the initial barrage of advertisements for unrelated products to the user, there are no further ads or popups to distract the user from their primary purpose on any given webpage they have navigated to, showing only information relevant to that page in particular.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Web developers have the responsibility of creating designs that facilitate the experience and cater to the needs of the user, without distracting the user or pushing them in a direction that does not have to do with their needs that have to be fulfilled. Overall, Telkom and its web staff have made a commendable effort in creating a site that creates an environment that is relevant and one that is easy to navigate, considering a variety of potential users with varying needs, without compromising the common experience of any one group of users.
