        <h2> Weekly Blog Posts</h2>
        <h3> These are the various blog posts we had done over the course of the semester; each being a reflection of the content we went through that week, as well as our experience with the course material up to that point.</h3>

                <h1>Blog One</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The week was the starting week and first introductory class in Interactive media. The course primarily has to do with front-end web development, which is to say, to process of designing and building sites intended to run on a browser.
                    <br> 
                    I had taken a look at the CBO, and it detailed some of what we would be going over and what we will eventually be assessed on during this semester as well as what we can expect for the final year submission. 
                    <br>
                    The bulk of the technical component being familiarising ourselves with the basic languages associated with web dev, namely HTML, CSS, and of course JavaScript. It helps that we had already done game design prior to this module, so general practices in coding as well as the concept of a good workflow/school of thought in creating and reiterating is not so foreign.  
                    <br>
                    The only practical work was setting up our GitHub Repositories with Andre.

                <h1>Blog Two</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This week was further building on the previous week's introductory material, however included this week was some dedicated time going through the HTML and the basics. I had partially done some HTML in high school, so it is not completely brand new, though much of it feels that way since it was so long ago. 
                    <br> 
                    The associated readings for the week delt with quite a few topics, concerning good form and user practices when design and creating websites, or rather the code for them. The segment on accessibility via screen readers was something new that I had never gave thought to previously, but interesting in how the software in browsers interacts with code rather than just being a platform to showcase it. 
                    <br>
                    The history of what is considered the internet is interesting in that unlike a few other technological developments, it was developed and promoted at a rather rapid pace, and after just 2 decades became an integral part of human society, not simply a tool to help out certain task.

                <h1>Blog Three</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This week was more fun than the last two and featured some good practical content as well.  
                    The introduction to CSS, unlike HTML, was something I had no prior experience in, so seeing the ways it in addition to HMTL are both used to structure and frame websites was new and exciting.                    
                    <br> 
                    CSS seems particularly robust and looking at a few sites online that all feature it in their development, or adaptations of it, was exciting and gave me a bit more insight into using the tool to make sites that are visually appealing in addition to functionally sound and appropriate. 
                    <br>
                    The relationship between what the user sees, and what they experience, and how they reinforce each other seems like one thing that, although can be reliably explained theoretically, has a large portion of intuition and feeling in order to really be able and grasp, and more important evoke within the products that they produce. It is something that I suspect, unlike code which remains static, is always changing with every project and the needs it has to fulfil.

                <br>
                <h1>Blog Four</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This week was fairly intensive, as it was our first serious encounter with JavaScript, which I now understand to be the brains of site, if HMTL and CSS are the body and outward appearance.                    
                    <br> 
                    It is a lightweight programming language that functionally controls everything interactable in the site, both known and unknown to the user. 
                    <br>
                    We were given a handful of exercises to do that our lecturer Andre released the memos for, and many of my solutions were incorrect or incomplete. It is still good practice seeing the things I went wrong in, and the ones I had sort of correct, how they could have been written and structured better.    
                    <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Blog Seven</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This week was relatively light, as it mainly had to with the ethics behind the work we are doing and would-be as future developers. It was interesting going through the material as it dealt with topic primarily to do with intent behind the decisions that teams take when implementing 
                    UI and in turn the desired response from the consumer 
                   <br> 
                    The most interesting insight was the segment on Dark UX. The idea behind using patterns and implementing that more so serve to benefit the companies behind the software rather than the customer using said software. It was most interesting observing Dark UX is not the result of poor or accidental UX design, but rather something much more directional and intentional.
